This plugin is a full rewrite by Chris Gralike of Derrick Smith's initial PHPSAML plugin for GLPI. This plugin has evolved quite a bit since then and is fully redesigned and rewritten to be compatible with GLPI 11. It now supports multiple SAML Identity Providers (IdPs), implements advanced user right rules, Just-In-Time (JIT) provisioning, and more. 

The plugin is fully configurable from the GLPI UI and doesn't require any coding skills. It uses GLPI core components where possible for maximum compatibility and maintainability. It utilizes Composer for quick 3rd party library updates if security issues require it. It follows PSR best practices and, most importantly, is written with a "security-by-design-by-default" approach to help you visually identify security issues.

## Key Capabilities & Features
* **Multiple SAML Identity Providers**: Configure and manage multiple IdPs simultaneously.
* **Just-In-Time (JIT) Provisioning**: Automatically create and update GLPI users dynamically on successful SAML login.
* **Flexible Claim Mapping**: Bind custom SAML assertion attributes and claims directly to GLPI user fields.
* **User Association & Authorization Rules**: Assign profiles, groups, and entities to users based on SAML claims.
* **Security Hardening**: Replay attack protection using assertion ID database tracking, strict time-window verification, and state-machine-backed login/logout flows.
* **Extensive Logging & Audit Trails**: Thorough logging of phase-by-phase login stages for security validation and SIEM monitoring.
* **Configuration Backup & Restore**: Built-in backup functionality to easily export and restore plugin configuration state.
* **Proxy Support**: Native compatibility with TLS-terminating proxies (Kubernetes Ingress, Traefik, HAProxy) using the "Requests Proxied" configuration setting.
* **Continuous Live Update Improvements**: Ongoing architectural updates ensuring seamless configuration adjustments and session synchronization.
* **Localizations**: Supports automated translation workflows to localize the interface for multiple languages.

## Building Awareness About the OSS Funding Gap
- 4000+ downloads and counting.
- Hours spent maintaining and supporting glpisaml/samlsso for the past 3 years: +1000h and counting. Coffees received YTD: 29. Hourly compensation for efforts: €0.145.
- I am not in the begging-for-money business, but I do want to build some awareness about the OSS funding gap problem. Be honest about the benefits and consider supporting the OSS projects you are using and making money off of (like GLPI). Building quality software is time-consuming and expensive!
